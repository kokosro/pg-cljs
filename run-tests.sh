# Compiles the cljs.test suite (shadow-cljs :node-test build) and runs it.
# Exit status: 0 when every test passes, non-zero otherwise.
#
# The build has :autorun true (tests execute on every compile/watch), but
# shadow-cljs does not propagate the autorun exit status, so we disable autorun
# for this one compile and run the generated script ourselves.
#
# CAVEAT: the last line is `exec` — this script REPLACES its shell with node, so
# never chain it mid-command (`./run-tests.sh && something` is fine from a parent
# shell, but nothing placed after the exec line inside this file would run).
#
# The tests never touch the network, a PostgreSQL server or a secrets file:
# `npm install` (first run only) fetches the toolchain plus `pg`; the REAL pg
# Client speaks to a wire-protocol fake socket (test/pg_cljs/fake_server.cljs,
# handed in through pg's `stream` option), so no database, password or
# network is involved — the one real socket opened goes to 127.0.0.1:9 to
# prove a refused connection is reported.
#
# The publicity gate runs FIRST: src/ and README.md are public documentation.
